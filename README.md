# Deepia 

Welcome to the GitHub page of [**Deepia**](https://www.youtube.com/@Deepia-ls2fo), my YouTube channel dedicated to creating educational animations about deep learning using Manim and Blender.

**Deepia** is a YouTube channel where I share animated explanations of various deep learning concepts. The goal is to make complex topics more accessible and understandable through engaging visual content rather than (sometimes boring) slideshows.

## Behind the Scenes 🎓

I'm Thibaut Modrzyk, a PhD student at [CREATIS](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/site/en) based in Lyon, France. My research focuses on the application of deep learning to medical imaging, specifically using a Compton Camera. This device reconstructs images from tracers using positron emission and Compton scattering. I am particularly interested in diffusion models and Bayesian imaging, and I explore these areas using a Plug-and-Play approach.

## Tools and Technologies 🛠️

- **Manim**: A powerful animation engine used to create mathematical animations.
- **Blender**: A comprehensive tool for creating and rendering 3D animations.
